### Steps to run on tomcat server 

http://www.thejavageek.com/2018/01/04/deploying-angular-app-tomcat/

Go to our app and run below command.
ng build --base-href=/angular/

    ng invokes angular
    build asks angular to build current app
    â€“base-href tells angular to create a reference directory where generated index.html file will be placed. So, in current case, generated files need to be placed in /angular folder in tomcat directory structure.

When command runs successfully, it creates all required files in dist folder as below.
We are ready to deploy angular app in tomcat. Just copy all these files and paste them in /angular folder under /webapps folder in tomcat.

Once copied, fire up the server and visit localhost:8080/angular/index.html and our bikes app should be seen running.
